This is a CWIPI plugin example code that couples two FF++ programs
and exchanges boundary mesh data between the two meshes created in
the two FF++ instance. 

To run the coupling code 

$> ff-mpirun -n 1 coupling11.edp -v 0 -cwipi-prefix s : -n 1 coupling1.edp -v 0 -cwipi-prefix r

Note:
-----

1) -cwipi-prefix : Is an identifier that is useful to identify the CWIPI instatnce
                In this example `-cwipi-prefix s` means the coupling11.edp instance
                has the identifier "FreeFem++-s" and the coupling1.edp has the
                identifier "FreeFem++-r".

2) We use the MPMD execution model of MPI to couple instances of code using CWIPI plugin
